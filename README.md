Raqm
====

Raqm is a small library to provide convenience functions for complex text
layout. It currently provides bidirectional text support (using [FriBiDi][fb]),
shaping (using [HarfBuzz][hb]), with proper script itemization.

Raqm is a source only library, you should just copy the source files in your
project and use them.

This is an early prototype and is still work in progress.

Raqm (Arabic: رَقْم) is writing, also number or digit and the Arabic word for
digital (رَقَمِيّ) shares the same root, so it is a play on “digital writing”.
